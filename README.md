# Steam-Gamers CS:GO ZE Configs

A collection of entWatch, stripper and BossHud configs for SG CS:GO ZE, please be aware that the stripper configs are not an extensive list of everything used on our server.

# How to Contribute

For making any of these configs, you'll want a tool like [VIDE](http://www.riintouge.com/VIDE/)'s entity lump editor, or [entSpy](https://gamebanana.com/tools/5876) to navigate the entities in a map. You can also compare maps with current configs in this repository and see how it has already been done if you're looking for functional examples of things.

**_IMPORTANT:_** Make sure the filename of the config matches the map name on the server.

## BossHud

Search for **math_counter**, **func_breakable**, **func_physbox** or **func_physbox_multiplayer** entities as a starting point when creating these. For each boss you're going to want a new block, make sure the blocks are numbered correctly if you're copy/pasting them. The format is available below.

**__IMPORTANT:__** If you want to make sure you are using the right boss entity, you can use [this plugin](https://github.com/gflclan-cs-go-ze/bhud-debugger) with a test server to find out.

```
"math_counter"
{
	"config" //OPTIONAL
	{
		"MultBoss"			"" //Does the map have two breakables/bosses at once? Useful to track 2 bosshp at once. 1 for enable.
		"HitMarkerOnly"			"" //Only shows HitMarkers + BossDamage Ranking. Useful for maps with built-in BossHud. 1 for enable.
		"BossBeatenShowTopDamage"	"" //Whether to show the top damagers of boss after it dies. 0 to disable.
	}
	"0"
	{
		//math_counter example
		"HP_counter"		"" //targetname of the hp math_counter
		"HPbar_counter"		"" //targetname of the math_counter that handles a hp bar (if applicable)
		"HPinit_counter"	"" //targetname of the math_counter that inits the hp math_counter (if applicable)
		"CustomText"		"" //custom name to show in the hud
		"HPbar_min"		"" //min value of the math_counter that handles a hp bar (if applicable)
		"HPbar_max"		"" //max value of the math_counter that handles a hp bar (if applicable)
		"HPbar_default"		"" //startvalue of the hpbar math_counter (if applicable)
		"HPbar_mode"		"" //which mode the hpbar math_counter runs on, 1=OnHitMin outputs 2=OnHitMax outputs (if applicable)
	}
	"1"
	{
		//func_breakable, func_physbox or func_physbox_multiplayer example
		"Type"			"breakable"
		"BreakableName"		"" //targetname of the func_breakable, func_physbox or func_physbox_multiplayer
		"CustomText"		"" //custom name to show in the hud
	}
}
```

## Stripper

Stripper is quite a complicated beast and unfortunately a single template is not really going to help you too much. If you're looking for a good starting point to learn Stripper, you can check out [this tutorial](https://gflclan.com/forums/topic/47449-stripper-cfgs-guide/). If you have any questions regarding stripper creation you can always join our [#mapping channel](https://discord.gg/zh2CVSM) on Discord for assistance.

## entWatch

Find entity classnames that start with "weapon_" as a starting point for creating these. For each item you're going to want a new block, make sure the blocks are numbered correctly if you're copy/pasting them. The format is available below.

```
"entities"
{
    "0"
    {
        "name"              "" //name of the item to show in chat
        "shortname"         "" //name of the item to show in scoreboard
        "color"             "" //colour to use in chat (refer to the colour list below)
        "buttonclass"       "" //what classname the button entity uses, usually just func_button
        "filtername"        "" //filtername that the items filter entity uses (if applicable, see below)
        "hasfiltername"     "" //true if the item uses a filter entity to check the user, false otherwise
        "blockpickup"       "" //always false
        "allowtransfer"     "" //true for human items, false for zm items
        "forcedrop"         "" //true for human items, false for zm items
        "chat"              "" //always true
        "hud"               "" //always true
        "hammerid"          "" //hammerid of the weapon_ entity for the item
        "energyid"	    "" //NEW! hammerid of math_counter if using modes 6 or 7
        "mode"              "" //NEW MODES! 0 = nothing 1 = spam protection only, 2 = cooldown, 3 = limited uses, 4 = limited uses with cooldown, 5 = cooldown that only gets triggered after all maxuses are used, 6 = fuel counter (onhitmin), 7 = fuel counter (onhitmax)
        "maxuses"           "" //max uses of the item (if applicable)
        "cooldown"          "" //cooldown of the item (if applicable)
        "maxamount"         "" //how many instances of this item can exist
        "buttonid"	    "" //Integer, NEW! Allows you to set the main button for which the cooldown will be considered. Use HammerID of button
        "physbox"           "" //NEW! OPTIONAL: "true" if this item is a physbox so it would allow bullets/knife to shoot/knife through. If it's false, dont bother adding this line.
        "pt_spawner"	    "" //String, NEW! Allows admins to spawn items. Can break the gameplay of the game on the map. Indicate Point_Template, which spawn the item
        "trigger"           "" //NEW! OPTIONAL: hammerid of the trigger that gives a player the item if one exists
    }
